# Basic Introduction
This project is part of the Digital Signal Processing course, offered by the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University in China.

In this project, I aim to achieve Sparse Foutier Transform (SFT) using matlab. This is not a novel idea and many papers have raised different methods or optimizations.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the inherent sparsity of signals in the frequency domain to accelerate the speed of Fourier Transform (FT).

For more detailed information, please refer to the [Readme.docx](Readme.docx), which also served as a project report for the course. Apologies for only providing the Chinese version at the moment. The file arrangement can be found at the end of the file.

# Disclaimer

This project is a **reproduction** of the concepts and methods presented in papers like [Simple and Practical Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/papers/sparse-fft-soda.pdf) and [稀疏傅里叶变换理论及研究进展](https://journal.bit.edu.cn/zr/cn/article/pdf/preview/10.15918/j.tbit1001-0645.2017.02.001.pdf). It is part of the **Digital Signal Processing** course at **Tsinghua University**. The implementation is intended for educational purposes only and is not an original work.

The code and materials provided here aim to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas discussed in the papers. While we have made every effort to ensure correctness, there may still be errors or omissions. Users are responsible for verifying the results and using this code at their own risk.

**Important Notice**:  
Students enrolled in the same course are strictly prohibited from using this code in any form without prior permission. Unauthorized use of this project, whether partially or entirely, for coursework, assignments, or evaluations violates academic integrity policies and is not allowed. Completing assignments independently is essential for developing practical skills and gaining a deeper understanding, which will greatly benefit students in the long run.
